# Cypress Learning

This repository shows off how to change your intercepts from a very basic implementation to a customizable, but more complex, intercept strategy.

## Running the website

To run the website, run the following commands:

```sh
cd ./todomvc
npm run start
```

This will start the website on `http://localhost:3000`. Be sure that you have nothing else running on that port, or starting the website will fail.

## Running the tests

To start Cypress, run the following command in a separate terminal than the website

```sh
npm run cypress
```

From there, select the `e2e` tests.

## Working through the lessons

The lessons are meant to be run in order, to show how you can go from a simple intercept strategy to a more complex one. The lessons work best when talked through, but they should be clear enough that you can follow the logic. If you have questions, feel free to ask in the `#cypress-automation` channel.
